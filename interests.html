	<h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>

	<p>I have always had an interest in technology since I was a little boy. It started with me playing around with a computer and finding out what it was capable of performing. I then started modding all of the gadgets I had. I modded my phone, video game consoles, and even my watch. Today, I enjoy coding.</p>

	<p>I have built a computer before.</p>

	<p>I have also written hundreds, if not thousands of lines of code during my academic and personal programming career.</p>

	<p>My favorite video game right now is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It is both a competitive fighting game and a casual party game, which means it accessible to a broad range of players. It also won the Best Fighting Game award at The Game Awards in 2019.</p>

	<p>During my free time, I don't watch TV shows or movies. Instead, I watch YouTube. My most favorite youtuber of all time is Etika. He was a young streamer known for his energetic reactions and hilarious, yet sincere personality.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, Etika died half a year ago. However, he will always hold a special place in my heart. </p>
